This is the FiddlesticksUltimateCalculator, a program which lets you enter the amount of AP you have, lets you select the level of your ultimate and allows you to enter how much MR the enemy has then calculates the total damage you would deal.

I used Java since I'm new to coding and just wanted to make a project that allows me to learn Java as well as apply my coding to something I like (LoL).
