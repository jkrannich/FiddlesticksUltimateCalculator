This is the FiddlesticksUltimateCalculator, a program which lets you enter the amount of AP you have, lets you select the level of your ultimate and allows you to enter how much MR the enemy has then calculates the total damage you would deal.

I used Java since I'm new to coding and just wanted to make a project that allows me to learn Java as well as apply my coding to something I like (LoL).

Just download "FiddlesticksUltimateCalculator.jar" and run it. Please dont make the window larger, I havent figured out how to scale it properly.

I'm planning to upadate it visually in the future, maybe add more options (i.e. being able to enter enemy amount of HP) and also add a calculator for his base abilities.
